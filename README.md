In Java, Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where opponents take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to achieve three of their marks ('X' or 'O') in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row to win. Implemented with object-oriented programming principles, the game features a console interface for interactive gameplay. It ensures valid moves through input validation and checks for winning conditions after each move. The updated grid is displayed after every move, and the game announces the winner or declares a draw upon completion. Tic Tac Toe in Java offers a fun and engaging experience for players.
